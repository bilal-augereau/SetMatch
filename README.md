SetMatch 🎾

SetMatch is a web application that allows users to simulate a tennis match, track the score, and view detailed stats such as the number of points played, sets won, and the current game progress.

Features

🎾 Simulate a Match: Generate random tennis points between two players based on their skill levels.
📊 Track Scoring: Displays the score for each set, the total sets won, and the current game.
🛠️ Backend Logic: The scoring logic, based on official tennis rules (e.g., sets, tie-breaks, advantage games), is handled in the backend.
🌟 Player Customization: Input player names, skill levels (1-10), and the number of points to simulate.

💻 Tech Stack:
